"dissertation" is my main Master's project from October 2021 to September 2023. It primarily focuses on speech anti-spoofing and involves an exploration of human auditory mechanisms, which is supervised by Prof. [Masashi Unoki](https://fp.jaist.ac.jp/public/Default2.aspx?id=293&l=1).

"[APSIPA2023](https://www.apsipa2023.org/)" is an international conference held in Taipei on Oct.31-Nov.3

"[jhes2023](http://jhes.jp/2023/doku.php?id=start)" was a domestic conference held online on Sept.2
